# Blastproof

A mod for Minecraft 1.9 snapshots which adds two config file options: to drop all blocks affected by an explosion, and to prevent item entities from being destroyed by explosions. Both are enabled by default. 

This mod can be run on just the server-side if you want.

Requires the [Meddle](https://github.com/FyberOptic/Meddle) mod loader, with the [DynamicMappings](https://github.com/FyberOptic/DynamicMappings) and [MeddleAPI](https://github.com/FyberOptic/MeddleAPI) mods installed.
